# QuantumPumping
Numerical simulations of Thouless pumping process in the Harper-Hofstadter model.
In upcoming updates, we will add also the class for the Rice-Mele model and pumping over a finite number of periods.


It requires the following python packages
numpy
scipy
tqdm
qutip 5.0
IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH QUTIP 4.7
